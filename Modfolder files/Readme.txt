Welcome to UnderQu4ke, a mod that turns Quake 4 into an Undertale style RPG. In this game, your blaster is used for attacking (primary fire) and acting (secondary fire), and all 10 of the other weapons in the game have been turned into equips that you can buy with gold in the shop (medics represent shopkeepers), you can buy items using the console to buy the specific item, or through hotkeys j, k, h, p. J gets the highest armor you can buy, K gets the highest weapon you can buy, h gets 10 health stims, and p gets a powerup.. All of the monsters represent enemies, which you can either kill to get xp and gold or spare to get gold only. Gunner enemies represent bosses, who drop higher gold and xp but take less damage from you and do more damage to you. Below you can find a list of the items with their respective prices/effects

machinegun = lightarmor, -2 damage, 50 gold
dmg = mediumarmor, -4 damage, 100 gold
grenadelauncher = superarmer, -6 damage, 150 gold
hyperblaster = divisionalarmor, /2 damage, 200 gold
lightninggun = powerup, increases attack/defense for 30 seconds, 100 gold
nailgun = twig, +20 attack, 50 gold
napalmgun = rock, +40 attack, 100 gold
railgun = knife, +70 attack, 150 gold
rocketlauncher = gun, +100 attack, 200 gold
shotgun = healthstims, 10 health per stim out of fight, 20 health per stim in fight, 10 stims, 50 gold.

To win a fight you either need to reduce the enemies health to 0 or complete 3 successful acts (5 if the enemy is a boss) 

Thank you and have fun.
